# Network and Functional Analysis of Ece1p-Human Interactome for Novel Target Identification
## Code for Visualization and analysis of Ece1p(*C. albicans*)-Human interactome.  
The analysis code can be found in the `Code/` folder.  
1. Number of interacting host genes of each peptide.py  
2. Significance of peptide overlap.py  
3. Cellular localization of peptide-interacting host proteins.py  
4. bar-overlap.R  
5. upset-gene.R
6. bar-GOenrichment.R  
7.  bar-GOenrichment-metascape.R  

Bioinformatics analysis in paper "Global fungal-host interactome mapping identifies a novel target 
of Candidalysin for fungal infection" were implemented by code above.
## Screening results of HT-eY2H
The 2nd screening results of HT-eY2H can be found in `Final list of genes for all peptides.xlsx`.
